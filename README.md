Official code release for the following paper:
"**SkillMimic: Learning Reusable Basketball Skills from Demonstrations**"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac75c9be-f144-4b6d-980f-272c6f657627)
We propose a novel approach that enables physically simulated humanoids to learn a variety of basketball skills from human demonstrations, such as
shooting (blue), retrieving (red), and turnaround layup (yellow). Once acquired, these skills can be reused and combined to accomplish complex tasks, such as
continuous scoring (green), which involves dribbling toward the basket, timing the dribble and layup to score, retrieving the rebound, and repeating the whole process.

## TODOs

- [ ] Release the complete raw BallPlay-M dataset and the data processing code.

- [x] Release a subset of the BallPlay-M dataset.

- [x] Release training and evaluation code.

## Installation üíΩ

Download Isaac Gym from the [website](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), then
follow the installation instructions.

Once Isaac Gym is installed, install the external dependencies for this repo:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Skill Policy

### Pre-Trained Models
Download the pre-trained models from here [link](https://??), unzip the files, and put them into `skillmimic/data/models/`. The directory structure should be like `skillmimic/data/models/mixedskills/nn/PhysHOI.pth`, etc.

### Inference
Run the following command.
```
python physhoi/run.py --test --task PhysHOI_BallPlay --num_envs 16 --cfg_env physhoi/data/cfg/physhoi.yaml --cfg_train physhoi/data/cfg/train/rlg/physhoi.yaml --motion_file physhoi/data/motions/BallPlay/[task].pt --checkpoint physhoi/data/models/[task]/nn/PhysHOI.pth
```
#### Tips
- You may control the skill switching using your keyboard. By default, the key and skill correspondence are as follows:
`1: pick up`, `2: shot`, `3: dribble left`, `4: dribble forward`, `5: dribble right`, `6: layup`, `7: turnaround layup`.
- You may change `--motion_file` to alter the initialization, or add `--init_start_frame` to disable random initialization.
- To view the HOI dataset, add `--play_dataset`.
- To save the images, add `--save_images test_images` to the command, and the images will be saved in `physhoi/data/images/test_images`.
- To transform the images into a video, run the following command, and the video can be found in `physhoi/data/videos`.
```
python physhoi/utils/make_video.py --image_path physhoi/data/images/test_images --fps 60
```

### Training üèãÔ∏è
To train the skill policy, run the following command: 
```
python physhoi/run.py --task PhysHOI_BallPlay --cfg_env physhoi/data/cfg/physhoi.yaml --cfg_train physhoi/data/cfg/train/rlg/physhoi.yaml --motion_file physhoi/data/motions/BallPlay/toss.pt --headless
```
During the training, the latest checkpoint PhysHOI.pth will be regularly saved to output/, along with a Tensorboard log.

#### Tips
- You may change the `--motion_file` to train skill policy on different data, e.g., `--motion_file physhoi/data/motions/skillset_1`.
- It is strongly encouraged to use large "--num_envs" when training on a large dataset, e.g., use "--num_envs 16384" for `--motion_file physhoi/data/motions/skillset_1`
